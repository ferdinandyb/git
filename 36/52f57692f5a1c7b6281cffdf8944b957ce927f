v3: - does not rely on remote set-head anymore so it only authenticates
    once
    - uses the new REF_CREATE_ONLY to atomically check if the ref exists
      and only write it if it doesn't
    - in all other cases the maximum it does is print a warning

v4: - instead of the discarded REF_CREATE_ONLY, it uses the existing,
      but updated transaction api to request a silent create only
    - it now uses the atomic before_target to determine reporting
    - refactored for legibility

v5: - instead of printing a not too useful message, it now fails
      silently, this in line with the objective to only set up
      remote/HEAD automatically if the right thing is trivial, for
      everything else there is remote set-head
    - fixed all failing tests
    - added two new tests, one for checking if remote/HEAD is set to the
      correct one, and one to test that we do not override remote/HEAD
      if it has changed on the server from what we have locally

v6: - fixed style issues and unintended extra empty line
    - updated function call with bool to int from previous patch's
      change
    - removed calls to error(...) inherited from builtin/remote.c so we
      actually fail silently
    - set the test for remote set-head --auto to the correct value here,
      which was previously erronously set in the remote set-head patch

v7: - no change

v8: - changed logmsg in call to refs_update_symref from "remote
      set-head" to "fetch"

v9: - follow through with refs_update_symref_extended
    - fix test errors uncovered by the new patch

v10: no change

v11: no change
