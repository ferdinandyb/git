RFC v1: Cf.

    For that particular series I've used
    git rev-list HEAD~8..HEAD | xargs -i git notes append {} -m "v12: no change"
    for a quick-start on updating notes, when only 1 note needed to be
    really edited with meaningful content, and for some of the patches
    you now need to scroll a bit to actually find that "no change" text,
    instead of seeing it right at the top.
