v4: new patch

v5: - added before_target to reftables backend
    - added an extra safety check for transaction's existence in refs.c

v6: - no change

v7: - remove the whole before_target concept from the backends and
      handle checking it in refs.c instead (thanks Karthik)
    - rename the before_target to referent which is how the same concept
      is called in the backends
    - change commit prefix to be more in line with project standards

v8: no change

v9: - instead of adding parameters to refs_update_symref, rename what
      was in v8 as refs_update_symref_extended and make refs_update_symref
      a wrapper for that. This significantly reduces the number of files
      that need to be touched, and avoids adding a lot of dummy NULL-s
      in unrelated places.

v10: no change

v11: no change

v12: no change

v13: if referent is a non-symbolic ref, record the hash in referent and
    signal this with a return value of -1
