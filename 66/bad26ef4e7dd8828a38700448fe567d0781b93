This patch is built off v15 of the set-head/fetch updates series:
https://lore.kernel.org/git/D5WEJJBMSO1K.2TPXDI1K08SHT@ferdinandy.com/T/#m13a0c3e8919872188ef07fd9fd984c78e8aa35ba

v2:
    - magic numbers converted to enum
    - since the enum is descriptive (well, along with the documentation)
      I felt there is no need for the comment explaining the values

v3: missed a magic number in v2
