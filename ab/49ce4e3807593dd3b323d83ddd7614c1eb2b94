v1-v2:

    was RFC in https://lore.kernel.org/git/20240910203835.2288291-1-bence@ferdinandy.com/

v3:

    This patch was originally sent along when I thought set-head was
    going to be invoked by fetch, but the discussion on the RFC
    concluded that it should be not. This opened the possibility to make
    it more explicit.

    Note: although I feel both things the patch does are really just
    cosmetic, an argument could be made for breaking it into two, one
    for the no-op part and one for the --auto print update.

v4:
    - changes are now handled atomically via the ref update transaction
    - outputs have changed along the lines of Junio's suggestion
    - minor refactor to set_head for improved legibility

v5: - the minor refactor has been split out into its own patch

v6: - fixed uninitialized prev_head
    - fixed case of unusual previous target
    - fixed a test that would have been actually broken at this patch
      (the output was only correct with the later update to fetch)
    - added 4 tests for the 4 output cases

v7: - change commit prefix to be more in line with project standards
    - fixed tests to also work with the reftable backend
    - renamed report function, fixed style issue with checking buf len
    - fixed not releasing an strbuf

v8: no change

v9: - mark output strings in report_set_head_auto as translatable
    - rename buf_prev to b_local_head for consistency
    - use ${SQ} in tests instead of '\''

v10: no change

v11: no change

v12: no change

v13: - add another output type for when the previous reference that is
       being overwriten is not a symboic reference
